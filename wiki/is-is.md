#### Intermediate System - Intermediate System (IS-IS)  

IS-IS  
*  an IS-IS network is a single autonomous system (a routing domain).  
*  link state - topology information is flooded throughout the AS, all routers get complete picture of the topology.  
*  uses Dijkstra.  
*  advantage is link state gives full topology picture;  can have scaling problems as the more routers the larger updates.  

CLNS
*  connectionless network service.  
*  network layer datagram service that requires no circuit establishment.  

Integrated IS-IS  
*  IS-IS was originally designed for use as a dynamic routing protocol for ISO CLNP.  
*  Aapated to carry IP prefixes in addition to CLNP.
