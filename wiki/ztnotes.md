#### Zero Trust
current problem:  
* number of FW  
* number of zones
* understand lateral movement 
* IAM complexity  
* lack of automation  

solution:  
*  crawl - flatten zones and combine networks 
*  greenfield zero trust - what do new deployments need to do to be certified  
*  > what is recipie  - things you have to do with new deployment
*  path to zero trust  
*  what does final state look like  

* one network and that network is the Internet  
* Zero Trust is needed to make that happen  
* all investments and work should be towards this goal
