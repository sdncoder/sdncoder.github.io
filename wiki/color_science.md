#### color science  
* cinemaDNG - open source format, not a set way for camera to put in metadata .  

method:  
* transform CDNG into linear space and convert to ARRI color and LogC.  
* RAW is just RGB values coming off the senson with no "color science" applied.  
* linear space is mathematically similar to RAW in that its just manipulating RGB values to take data and fold it to a curve that looks good in a set color space.
