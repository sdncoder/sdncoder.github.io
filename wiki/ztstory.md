* zero trust is a security model and microsegmantation is a best practice that can help organizations realize that vision.  
* zero trust grants user access according to the principle of "least privledge", provides only enough access for each user to perform job.  
* micro-segmentation builds perimeters around specific applicatoins and data.
* build infrastructure to determine traffic-flows between every workload - groom systems into micro zones to decrease their attack surface.
