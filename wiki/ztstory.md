#### create the zero trust story  
* zero trust is a security model and microsegmantation is a best practice that can help organizations realize that vision.  
* zero trust grants user access according to the principle of "least privledge", provides only enough access for each user to perform job.  
* micro-segmentation builds perimeters around specific applicatoins and data.
* build infrastructure to determine traffic-flows between every workload - groom systems into micro zones to decrease their attack surface.  

#### death of vpn  
* has become inefficient and insecure.  
* use any device and cloud applications do not work with traditional VPN-relianct architecture.  
* future network is one that is not bound by tradiional VPN-reliant architecture.  
* VPN are gateways that allow employees to access internal resources from a remote location.  
* line between internal and external is gone.  
* rapid migration of applications to the cloud;  no longer shielded by a secure network perimeter with clear demarcation points.  


*  the wider the perimeter, the larger the risk.

* user connecting via VPN is inherently granted a level of access that's almost always in excess of the minimum required.  
* with legacy VPN even a well-designed and segmented network would leave a wide range of network resources visible to parties that should not need to see those resources.  

#### better solution  
* zero-trust architecture provides an alternative model that prevents "trusted" users from gaining accessive access to a network, simply because there are no trusted users on the network to begin with.  
* SDP - software-defined perimeter  - conceal infrastructure connected to the internet to prevent visibility.
