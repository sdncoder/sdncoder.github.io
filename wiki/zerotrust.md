Zero trust means no one should be automatically trusted, once verified only limited access should be given.  
ZTA focuses on who and what is accessing the network.  

### Zero Trust Network Intrastructure  
*  user to application segmentation.  
*  The zero-trust model moves security away from implied trust that is based on network location. 
*  Focuses on evaluating trust on a per-transaction basis.  
*  With zero trust, network location or IP address no longer conveys an implication of trust.  

#### Zero Trust Access  
*  ZTA is about knowing and controlling who and what is on your network.  
*  Role-based access.  
*  ZTA covers user endpoints where management control and visibility is required.  
*  Headless devices - network access control (NAC) solutions can be used to discover and control access.  
*  NAC policies to implement the zero trust principles of least access.
