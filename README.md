## Ansible configuration deployment
standardization and automation
verify base config across network
CICD for the network infrastrucutre has limitations
The "test" ability is limited.   Example. using BatFish, GNS, or VIRL is limited.
These are not real network tests.
CICD in the web space..the build truly is the same; just using a differenet DNS name bewteewn stage/dev/prod.
Testing your network config againt BatFish equates to is this config standardized (ACL, etc); there are better ways to really do that ~ lab router

## Text parsing deployment state

`sudo apt install snapd`
