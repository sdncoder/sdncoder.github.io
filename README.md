## a network engineering pipeline
standardization and automation
verify base config across network


## site reliability engineering the network backbone
use software and automation to solve network problems

if config is not standard, if new routers are not added to monitoring systems, if the information about the network is not accurate; reliablity will decrease...it will be a "network problem".
