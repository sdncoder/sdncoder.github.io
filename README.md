## A network deployment framework

A set of tools used to deploy network infrastructure(s) at scale.  
**The framework should:**   
* Allow engineers to focus on the design and configuration by providing low-level funcationaly.  
* Provide team-based configuration management with revision control and review/approval capabilites.  
* Manage pre-production testing and build state analysis.

### The framework tools:  
* [Automate configuration deployment with Ansible](#Automate-configuration-deployment-with-ansible)
* [Text parsing deployment state](#text-parsing-deployment-state)
* [QA with Robot Framework](#qa-with-robot-framework)


### Automate configuration deployment with Ansible
Ansible is the best (my opinion) open source multi-vendor tool for network device configuration.
* _SSH front-end_ - execute playbooks using vendor libraries via SSH.
* _well known command structure_ - yaml files are built using known network device CLI structure.
*
